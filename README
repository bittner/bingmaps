Bing Maps (Unofficial)
----------------------

Bing Maps on Ubuntu Touch. This web app provides convenient access to
Microsoft's browser based mapping and routing service Bing.

Bing is special for its "bird's eye view" map style. This is a 3D (three
dimensional) view created with the help of pictures taken from planes
capturing stripes of a geographical area, and computed together with
algorithms researched and developed at Graz University of Technology, Austria.
Those algorithms were commercially developed in the United States by Vexcel
Corporation, Boulder (CO), an entity founded by Austrian university professor
Franz Leberl, which has been acquired by Microsoft in 2006.

The normal street maps as well as the routing service are provided by HERE,
formerly known as Ovi Maps and Nokia Maps. You may want to try the HERE app
on your Ubuntu Touch device for a more feature-rich implementation, and a
slightly better working (GPS) locate function.
